👉🏻 PROCESS: 

• First, analyze what users want from the Grocery Inventory Portal. Storyboarding and Layout Sketching had been used to design the web pages.

• Second, for all pages, use HTML and CSS to implement web design.

• Third, error detection was implemented using JavaScript and Regex so that anytime a user enters invalid data in any form on any page, an error is described in an informative manner on the input box.

• Fourth, utilizing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to plan a relational database and MySQL to implement it. (Tested Queries such as Create, Update, Delete, Join, etc.)

• Fifthly PHP was used to construct a database back-end connection. Data storage and retrieval through a series of queries.

• Finally, use AJAX and JSON to construct a front-end data update that happens every few seconds (Without refreshing the page).
